Source code from the subversion repository
------------------------------------------

To compile source code obtained from the subversion repository,
make sure you have installed the autoconf, automake and libtools packages.
Execute
$ autoreconf -i


Creating a new release
----------------------

1) Check the version number in configure.ac ("AC_INIT (mpc, _version_...)"),
   in INSTALL, and in src/mpc.h (remove suffix in MPC_VERSION_STRING).
2) Disactivate the -Werror option in configure.ac.
3) Check that NEWS, BUGS and TODO are up to date, and that the minimal
   version numbers of gmp and mpfr in configure.ac, INSTALL and
   doc/mpc.texi are correct.
4) Execute "autoreconf; touch doc/mpc.texi; make distcheck".
   This updates the date and version number in doc/version.texi and
   creates the tarball for distribution.
5) Create an svn tag from inside the svn root:
   svn cp trunk tags/VERSION -m "Tagging release VERSION"
6) Update the web page inside svn and on the server.
   The html documentation is created with
      makeinfo --html --no-split mpc.texi
   and the resulting mpc.html is copied to content_html.php.
7) After the release, update the version number in configure.ac, INSTALL
   and src/mpc.h.
8) Reactivate the -Werror option in configure.ac.
9) Commit the changes to svn.
